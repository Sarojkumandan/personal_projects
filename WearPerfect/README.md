# WearPerfect: AI-Powered Weather-Based Outfit Recommendation System

## 🌟 Project Overview

WearPerfect is an AI-powered intelligent outfit recommendation system designed to enhance everyday clothing decisions through personalization and contextual awareness. The platform helps users select the most suitable outfits from their own wardrobe by taking into account real-time weather conditions, planned travel details, and social context (such as formal, casual, or party settings).

Users begin by uploading images of their clothing items, which the system processes using advanced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract visual features like sleeve length, lower clothing length, neckline, and more. These extracted features are then fed into a rule-based scoring mechanism that evaluates each item’s warmth, breathability, and occasion appropriateness using scientifically grounded metrics.

The combination of personal wardrobe data, weather intelligence, and context-aware scoring enables the system to deliver practical, tailored recommendations. Whether it's deciding what to wear today or packing smartly for an upcoming trip, WearPerfect acts as a virtual stylist, ensuring that users are both comfortable and stylish in any situation.

## Dataset and Assumptions

We used the [**DeepFashion-MultiModal Dataset**](https://github.com/yumingj/DeepFashion-MultiModal), containing full-body clothing images. After preprocessing:

- Cropped into top wear and bottom wear separately.
- Removed irrelevant items (e.g., accessories, socks).

**Assumptions:**

- Users upload clean, front-facing clothing images.
- Scores (warmth, breathability) are based on ISO standards and thermal comfort literature.

## Deployment

* GitHub Repository ✅
* Future scope: Render, Streamlit, or Hugging Face Spaces

---

## Future Scope

* Integrate Virtual Try-On (e.g., StableVITON):
Allow users to visualize how recommended outfits would look on a dummy avatar or user model using pre-trained virtual try-on models like StableVITON. This will enhance user engagement and decision-making by offering a visual preview of outfit combinations.

* Advanced Scoring with Color Psychology & Trend Detection:
Incorporate color theory to suggest outfits that match the user’s mood or event tone (e.g., calming tones for interviews, vibrant for parties). Integrate trend analysis based on current fashion data to keep suggestions modern and seasonally relevant.

* Multi-language and Voice Interface Support:
Expand accessibility by adding support for multiple languages and voice commands — allowing users from various regions and age groups to interact with the system naturally.

* User Feedback Loop for Personalization:
Introduce a system where users can rate or like outfit suggestions. Over time, the system will adapt and personalize future recommendations based on user preferences, creating a more intuitive and user-centered experience.

* Extended Forecasting for Travel Planning:
Leverage long-range or premium weather APIs to support travel planning beyond the current 14-day limit. This enables the chatbot to give more reliable packing suggestions for longer or more complex trips.

## Limitations

While **WearPerfect** demonstrates the potential of AI-assisted wardrobe planning, the current version has several limitations:

### ⏳ Limited Weather Forecast Horizon
- The OpenWeatherMap API only supports up to **14-day forecasts**
- Limits the accuracy of **long-term travel planning**

### 🧺 Prototype-Grade Virtual Wardrobe
- Current UI supports only **basic uploads and suggestions**
- Lacks advanced features:
  - Tagging
  - Bulk uploads

### 🖼️ No Real-Time Clothing Detection or Try-On (Yet)
- Users must upload **static images**  
- **Virtual try-on** with avatars or real-time fitting is a planned enhancement

### 📏 Fixed Scoring System
- Warmth, breathability, and occasion scores are **predefined**
- Not yet **adaptive** to:
  - User preferences  
  - Regional/climatic variations  
  - Fashion trends  

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 No Multi-User Wardrobe Sharing or Syncing
- Wardrobes are currently tied to **individual sessions**
- No support for:
  - **Cloud-based sync**
  - **Collaborative wardrobes** (e.g., family, stylist-client)
